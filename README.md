R scripts for reformatting metabarcoding databases

We are working on DNA-metabarcoding of marine benthic communities.
We are using a motley array of scripts  and utilities from diverse sources.
This sometimes implies cumbersome format changes of huge files.
This is a collection of R scripts which help to automatize these conversion tasks.
